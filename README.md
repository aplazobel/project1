# Project global-shark-attacks

## Objective
In this project we were given the task to organize a large raw dataset and extract valuable information from it. The dataset provided numerous facts about shark attacks all around the world.

## Step 1: Cleanup
First of all I started by dropping the empty rows or those that did not offer enough information to be relevant. Then I removed irrelevant columns. I dropped those with duplicate information and those which were not insightful towards my hypthesis. I also changed the column names to be manipulated in easier ways. 

## Step 2: Data Analysis and Hypotesis Testing
In this step I provided my hypothesis, which is the following:
### -Most provoked attacks happened to swimmers
To do so I was meant to compare the number of provoked attacks to those suffered by swimmers and try to find a correlation
